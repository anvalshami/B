*   **Beads:** This is the heart of your project! Choose from a wide variety of colors, sizes, and materials, including seed beads, bugle beads, glass beads, and more. Experiment to find what you like.
*   **Thread:** The type of thread you use will depend on the type of beads and the complexity of your project. Nylon thread, beading thread, and even strong fishing line are popular choices.
*   **Needles:** Beading needles are thin and flexible, making them ideal for threading beads. Choose a needle size that is appropriate for the size of your beads.

*   **Beading Mat:** A beading mat will help to prevent your beads from rolling away and make it easier to pick them up.

### Basic Beading Techniques:

*   **Stringing:** The most basic technique, stringing involves threading beads onto a single strand of thread. This is often used for simple necklaces and bracelets.
*   **Weaving:** Weaving involves interlacing threads to create a more complex and durable structure. This is a common technique for bead embroidery and bead weaving projects.
*   **Looms:** A bead loom can be used to create intricate patterns and designs, making it easier to bead large areas.
*   **Brick Stitch:** A flat stitch that creates a strong and visually appealing surface, ideal for creating panels or adding embellishments.
*   **Peyote Stitch:** Another popular flat stitch, the peyote stitch creates a textured surface and is often used for creating beadwork jewelry and accessories.
