## Why Boundaries in the Workplace Training Matters

Boundaries aren't about building walls; they're about defining personal limits and expectations for how you interact with colleagues, supervisors, and even clients. They are fundamental to a healthy and productive work life. Without clear boundaries, individuals risk burnout, stress, conflict, and decreased job satisfaction. For companies, a lack of boundary awareness can lead to a toxic work environment, legal issues, and reputational damage.

Here's why boundaries in the workplace training is so important:
