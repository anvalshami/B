## A Deep Dive into Loan Documents: A Crucial Skill

Mastering the art of understanding loan documents is paramount. A quality course will equip you with the knowledge to navigate the intricate world of mortgages and real estate paperwork. Here's a breakdown of key document types:

*   **Promissory Note (The Note):** This is the borrower's promise to repay the loan amount, outlining the terms of repayment, interest rate, and any applicable late fees.
*   **Deed of Trust/Mortgage:** This document secures the loan by creating a lien on the property. It specifies the terms of foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Understanding the difference between a Deed of Trust and a mortgage is crucial, as the foreclosure process varies depending on the document type.

*   **Grant Deed:** Transfers ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer.
*   **Affidavits and Certifications:** These documents affirm specific facts or compliance with certain regulations, such as a Patriot Act Affidavit.
*   **Right to Cancel:** This document informs the borrower of their right to cancel the transaction within a specific timeframe, typically three business days.
