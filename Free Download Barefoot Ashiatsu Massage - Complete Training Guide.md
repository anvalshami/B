## What is Barefoot Ashiatsu Massage and Why Learn It?

Barefoot ashiatsu massage is a form of deep tissue bodywork where the therapist uses their feet to deliver massage strokes. Unlike traditional hand-based massage, ashiatsu utilizes gravity and broad surface area of the foot to provide a deeper, more consistent pressure. This allows for longer strokes and less strain on the therapist's hands and wrists. The benefits are numerous, both for the client and the practitioner.
